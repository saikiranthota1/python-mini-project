# ðŸ§© 2048 Game in Python (Tkinter)

This project is a Python-based clone of the popular 2048 game. It uses the `tkinter` library for GUI and follows the original 2048 game mechanics, with smooth tile merging, grid updates, and customizable appearance.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- The goal is to **combine tiles to reach 2048**.
- Use your keyboard to slide tiles:
  - `W` â€“ Move Up
  - `A` â€“ Move Left
  - `S` â€“ Move Down
  - `D` â€“ Move Right
- Tiles with the same value merge when they collide.
- Game ends when you either reach **2048** or **no moves are left**.
